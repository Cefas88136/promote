            <p>The 2022 FIFA World Cup is scheduled to be the 22nd running of the FIFA World Cup competition, the quadrennial international men's football championship contested by the national teams of the member associations of FIFA. It is scheduled to take place in Qatar from 21 November to 18 December 2022. This will be the first World Cup ever to be held in the Arab world, and it will be the second World Cup held entirely in Asia after the 2002 tournament was held in South Korea and Japan.</p><p>In addition, the tournament will be the last to involve 32 teams, with an increase to 48 teams scheduled for the 2026 tournament in the United States, Mexico, and Canada. The reigning World Cup champions are France.Due to Qatar's intense summer heat, this World Cup will be held from late-November to mid-December, making it the first tournament not to be held in May, June, or July; it is to be played in a reduced timeframe of around 28 days</p>

        <div class="child"><h1>Qatar is hosting</h1><br>

            <p>Accusations of corruption have been made relating to how Qatar won the right to host the event. A FIFA internal investigation and report cleared Qatar of any wrongdoing, but chief investigator Michael J. Garcia has since described FIFA's report on his enquiry as containing "numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations." On 27 May 2015, Swiss federal prosecutors opened an investigation into corruption and money laundering related to the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bids.</p><p>On 6 August 2018, former FIFA president Sepp Blatter claimed that Qatar had used "black ops", suggesting that the bid committee had cheated to win the hosting rights. Additionally, Qatar has faced strong criticism due to the treatment of foreign workers involved in preparation for the World Cup, with Amnesty International referring to "forced labour" and stating that hundreds or thousands of migrant workers have died as a result of human rights abuses, and careless and inhumane work conditions, despite worker welfare standards being drafted in 2014.</p>

            <p>Only after the much-discussed assignment did doubts arise about the climate during a World Cup in Qatar. An average afternoon temperature in the shade of 40 degrees in June and July is very warm to play football at world level for an hour and a half.</p><p>This has caused some discussion and concern at the headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland. Finally, FIFA decided to play the tournament in the winter. Despite protests from clubs and football associations that see their schedule for the competition and the Champions League come under pressure.</p><p>In the winter months, the average temperature in Qatar is around 29 degrees.</p>

        <div class="child"><h1>World Cup 2022 Qualifying</h1><br>

            <p>55 UEFA World Cup qualifiers will take part, 13 of which will qualify for the 2022 World Cup. Qualifying matches will be played from March 2021 to March 2022.

                If a country wants to withdraw earlier than 30 days before the start of the main tournament, it will cost them 250,000 Swiss Francs. If a country wants to withdraw within 30 days or during the event, they will pay a fine of 500,000 Swiss Francs. FIFA may decide to send a replacement country to the World Cup.</p>
                
                <p>The World Cup qualification consists of two phases: the group phase and the play-offs. The group stage consists of 10 groups of 5 or 6 countries, of which the numbers 1 qualify directly. The play-offs are played by the 10 numbers 2 from the group stage + 2 countries that have not yet qualified from the Nations League.</p>
